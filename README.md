# APPL_Stock_Prediction
This project uses Machine Learning models to predict the closing stock prices of Apple Inc. (AAPL) based on historical stock market data. It involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of predicted results against actual stock values.
# Project Objective
To build an ML model that can learn patterns from historical stock data and forecast future stock prices of AAPL with high accuracy. This can aid investors and analysts in making informed decisions.
# Dataset
- *Source*: [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/)
- *Features*:
  - Date
  - Open
  - High
  - Low
  - Close
  - Volume
The dataset includes several years of AAPL daily stock price data and is preprocessed for supervised learning tasks.
# Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation
- Scikit-learn – Machine Learning (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization
- XGBoost / RandomForest / Linear Regression
- Jupyter Notebook
# Features
	•	Load & clean historical AAPL stock data
	•	Visualize stock trends over time
	•	Train & evaluate regression models
	•	Predict future stock prices
	•	Plot predicted vs actual prices

# Models Used
Several regression models are tested for prediction:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor
- LSTM (optional, for deep learning extension)

Models are evaluated based on:
- *R² Score*
- *Mean Squared Error (MSE)*
- *Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)*

# How to Run the Project
1. *Clone the repository*
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aapl-stock-prediction.git
   cd aapl-stock-prediction
2.install the dependencie
pip install -r requirements.txt
3.Run the notebook
jupyter notebook notebooks/stock_price_model.ipynb
4.(Optional) Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run app/predictor.py

# Sample Output
Date          Actual Price      Predicted Price
2024-12-01    $195.23           $193.84
2024-12-02    $196.10           $195.77
# Future Enhancements
	•	Add deep learning models (LSTM, GRU)
	•	Real-time data fetching via Yahoo Finance API
	•	Deployment via Streamlit or Flask
	•	Interactive dashboard for users
